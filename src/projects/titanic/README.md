## 📘 Tutorial Reference

I’m following and expanding upon the official Kaggle tutorial by **Alexis Cook**:

👉 [Titanic Tutorial on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial)

This serves as a great starting point for:
- Understanding basic **data cleaning** and **feature engineering**
- Building a **baseline machine learning model**
- Submitting predictions to Kaggle
